# PyEloqua-Examples
Examples of using Python alongside Eloqua

# PyEloqua.py
Functions for interacting with Eloqua's Bulk API. Currently, has only been tested with import/export of CDO record,s although more functionality is planned.

# Contacts.LeadType_getOfferDetails.py
A script which uses PyEloqua to export records from a CDO, find the corresponding campaign (offer) details in Salesforce, then re-import the records.
Note: This script uses an instance-specific CDO and the code cannot be directly re-used without modification.
